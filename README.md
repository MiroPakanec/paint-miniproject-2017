# paint-miniproject-2017

-- Motivation
During my summer vocation I have begin to explore a javascript library called p5.js. 
It is a library for visualizations and drawing, and so naturally the first project, which I have made was indeed paint. 
While the project does not have a server-side language and is intirely build with javascript, 
I have puth a great deal of focus into designing it with a sense of reusability, adaptability and extendability. 
While my goal was primeraly to grasp the p5.js library, I have also attempted to create a project that is neat and easy to understand. 

-- About
The application is a simple drawing program. 
The user is provided with a simple, rather minimalistic interface, allowing him to perform simple operations, 
such as change brush color, size, transparency, border and shape. The user can also choose between either the brush or the rubber. 
In my opinion a particullarly interesting user story to implement was undo/ redo user action, where I took the advantage of command pattern.
Finally I used bootstrap to adjust the project and canvas to any device width and legth.
